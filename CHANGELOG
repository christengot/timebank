0.2	 --	Function "showt()" now can show percentages of tags,
		with better display format.

0.3  --	Fixed bug[0] by creating function "change()" which
		edits settings one at a time. Added "setup()" for
		easy bank initialization. "bank" file now uses five
		rows for settings, the last two being sleep time per
		sleep scope and estimated time slept for scope.
		Fixed bug[1], making sleep estimate truly accurate.

0.4	 --	Created functions "start()" and "end()", which when
		used together, record time for an activity and return
		the value. Fixed a runtime error where changing the
		unit leaves out writing of the estimated sleep time.
