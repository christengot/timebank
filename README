# Timebank
#
# Started in July, 2012.
# Last updated on 08/12/2012.
# Current version:	0.2
# Made and tested using python v2.6.6 in Crunchbang Statler.
#
# This is a simple, Mint-inspired time manager,
# designed to help track time spent on activities and
# display them in an easy, useful manner.
#
# This project is nowhere near finished and barely tested.
# Use "help" in python for details on individual functions.
#
# Overview:
# 
# 	Time is logged using "banks".  Banks are stored as a
# 	single file named "mybank".  It is highly recommended
# 	that you rename the bank once it's scope is over (for
# 	example, if "mybank" represents Mon - Sun, rename on
# 	next Monday and setup a new bank for that week).
#
# 	The scope of a bank isn't set in stone.  It can be
# 	changed on the fly using the "change()" command,
# 	along with the display unit and other settings
# 	(see help(change()) for usage).
#
# Usage:
#
# 	This program requires Python to be installed, preferably
# 	version 2.6.6.  Version 3 of python will likely work,
# 	but has not been tested yet (so may be buggy). This
# 	program has also been untested in anything other than *Nix
# 	(Crunchbang Statler, to be exact).
#
# 	To load Timebank, open python in the Timebank program
# 	directory, and execute "import tb" or "from tb import *".
# 	The latter is preferred, as you can call each command
# 	directly by name (instead of prefixing "tb." to each).
# 	However, this could create conflicts if another module
# 	with functions or global variables of the same name is
# 	loaded after Timebank, thus overriding Timebank's own.
#
# 	To start using Timebank, you first need a bank file.
# 	To create one using the default values, simply run
# 	"setup()" with no parameters in the parenthesis. You
# 	can change the settings later by using "change()".
#
# 	After creating the bank, add items using
# 	"debit(<time>, <tag>)".  To see your debits, use
# 	"showt()".  Remember to enclose non-number values
# 	using quotes, or the program will error.
#
# 	If the program does error during operation, don't fret --
# 	if your bank has been corrupted, you can restore it by
# 	replacing it with it's backup, <bankname> + '~'. Then
# 	report the bug at the Timebank github repository so it's
# 	fixed at the next release. :)
#
# 	If you have any complaints or suggestions, feel free to
# 	email me and although I may not answer all, I will surely
# 	read them.
